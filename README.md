# E-commerce Backend

## Description

- The purpose of this week's challenge was to create SQL data using Sequelize and as well as api routes so that I am able to confirm and test all the data I created. With the routes I created, I can test to see, create, update and delete data from each category, product, and tag model on Insomnia. Doing this project, I learned how much easier it is to manage SQL tables and data using Sequelize.

## Installation

- To be able to use this application, nodejs, sequelize and Insomnia should be installed to user's machine.

    Nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/

    Sequelize : https://sequelize.org/
